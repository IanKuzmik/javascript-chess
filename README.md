# javascript-chess
This is a simple chess simulator (game?) written in vanilla Javascript. I'm making use of the Canvas for this game, and architechting in a OOP style

Acomplished so far:
  draw the board and pieces
  move pieces according to their rules
  
Still to do:
  detect collision (only knights can jump other pieces)
  write the opponent AI so this is actually a game
  odd and ends
